## Description
  The readme generator is a node.js app that will prompt the user with a series of questions to built a readme based on user input. It will display description, installation instruction, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions and more. After input is satisfied, the app will generate a readme markdown fil in the dist directory for the user to copy and use.


## Installation
  This app runs on node, so to use it, the user must have npm and inquirer initiated on thier command line. After using the commands "npm init" and "npm i inquirer" the user then may enter "node index" on the command line in the "develop" envirnment (inside the develop directory) to then ne prompted with questions about thier project.

## Testing
  I included a video in the assets folder of me operating the app. You can see there how to run the app, and how it functions. Based off of that video you can see where and what to add to the line of questions. I also included a link to the video on google drive here vvv
